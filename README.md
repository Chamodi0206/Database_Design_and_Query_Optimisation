# 🗃️ Database Design & Query Optimization System (SQL, NoSQL & Graph)

Welcome! This repository showcases how to design and optimize databases—SQL, NoSQL, and Graph—for handling complex relationships and large datasets. It highlights real-world approaches for schema design, query formulation, and performance tuning, providing a robust understanding of database choices and query optimizations.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
In this project, I tackle a complex dataset with entities such as users, posts, comments, and friendships, and I demonstrate how different databases can handle relationships and querying. This repository includes:

- **SQL Schema & Queries**: Relational database design for structured and well-defined data.
- **NoSQL Schema & Queries**: Flexible document-based design for scalable, unstructured data.
- **Graph Database Schema & Queries**: Graph-based design for deep relationship traversal and analysis.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate how to select the right database type for different data models and workloads, as well as to optimize queries for performance.

## 🔧 Key Technologies Used

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **PostgreSQL/MySQL** | Relational SQL database for structured data |
| **MongoDB** | NoSQL document database for flexible schema |
| **Neo4j** | Graph database for traversing complex relationships |
| **SQL** | Query language for relational databases |
| **Cypher** | Query language for graph databases |
| **JavaScript** | Used in NoSQL queries (MongoDB) for data interaction |

## ⚙️ Core Architecture

This system is built around handling three types of database schemas for different use cases:

### 1. **SQL Database**
   - A **relational schema** is used to represent structured data with relationships defined through foreign keys.
   - Example tables: Users, Posts, Comments, Friendships.

### 2. **NoSQL Database**
   - A **document-based schema** is used to store flexible data in JSON-like formats.
   - Example collections: Users, Posts, Comments.

### 3. **Graph Database**
   - A **graph schema** is used to define relationships (nodes and edges), making it efficient for querying relationships like "friends of friends."
   - Example nodes: Users, Posts. Example relationships: Friend, Commented, Posted.

## 💡 Key Features

### Database Schema Design
Each database type (SQL, NoSQL, Graph) has its own schema design to represent the entities and relationships involved:

1. **SQL**: Tables for users, posts, comments, and friendships, ensuring data integrity.
2. **NoSQL**: JSON documents representing the same entities but with more flexibility.
3. **Graph**: Nodes representing users and posts, with relationships like "friend" and "commented".

### Query Optimization
- **SQL**: Efficient joins, indexing, and aggregation techniques.
- **NoSQL**: Data embedding vs referencing, and indexing on frequently queried fields.
- **Graph**: Query pattern optimization and minimizing unnecessary node traversal.

### Performance Considerations
- SQL: Proper indexing, query optimization for large datasets, and normalization.
- NoSQL: Sharding, indexing, and using aggregation pipelines for complex queries.
- Graph: Optimizing depth-first or breadth-first traversal to limit performance overhead.

## 🛠️ Sample Queries & Problems Solved

Each database type has sample queries to demonstrate its power and versatility.

### SQL Queries

**Problem**: Retrieve all posts by friends of a given user (User ID = 1)

```sql
SELECT posts.*
FROM posts
JOIN friendships ON posts.user_id = friendships.friend_id
WHERE friendships.user_id = 1;
```

**Optimization**: Indexing on `user_id` and `friend_id` columns to speed up lookup times.

### NoSQL Queries

**Problem**: Get all posts by friends of a given user (User ID = "u1")

```javascript
// Get all posts by friends of user "u1"
db.posts.find({ user_id: { $in: ["u2", "u3"] } });
```

**Optimization**: Create indexes on `user_id` and `created_at` fields for faster queries.

### Graph Database Queries (Neo4j)

**Problem**: Find mutual friends between two users (User IDs = "u1" and "u2")

```cypher
MATCH (user1:User {id: "u1"})-[:FRIEND]->(mutualFriend:User)<-[:FRIEND]-(user2:User {id: "u2"})
RETURN mutualFriend;
```

**Optimization**: Neo4j optimizes relationship traversal, but queries should limit the depth to avoid performance issues.

## 🔨 Query Optimization Strategies

For each database type, several techniques can optimize performance, particularly when handling large datasets:

- **SQL**: Use proper indexing on foreign keys, create composite indexes, and avoid `SELECT *` queries.
- **NoSQL**: Use appropriate data modeling for embedding vs referencing. Optimize queries using the aggregation pipeline and projections to fetch only required fields.
- **Graph**: Reduce the traversal depth when querying complex relationships, and ensure nodes are indexed where necessary.

## 💭 SQL vs NoSQL vs Graph

| Use Case                           | SQL       | NoSQL      | Graph   |
|-------------------------------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Data with strict relationships     | ✅        | ❌         | ✅      |
| Flexible, evolving schema          | ❌        | ✅         | ✅      |
| Deep relationship analysis          | ❌        | ❌         | ✅      |
| Complex queries with joins         | ✅        | ❌         | ❌      |
| High-speed transactions with ACID  | ✅        | ❌         | ❌      |
| Performance with large volumes      | ❌        | ✅         | ✅      |

- **SQL** is best for structured data where data integrity and ACID transactions are crucial.
- **NoSQL** is ideal for scenarios where flexibility, scalability, and high availability are required.
- **Graph** is perfect when relationships between entities are central, and deep connections need to be queried efficiently.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **SQL**
   - Load `sql/schema.sql` into PostgreSQL or MySQL.
   - Run `queries.sql` to test various queries.

2. **NoSQL**
   - Load `nosql/sample_documents.json` into MongoDB.
   - Use `nosql/queries.js` to interact with the database.

3. **Graph**
   - Load `graph/schema.cypher` into Neo4j.
   - Execute queries in the Neo4j Browser using `graph/queries.cypher`.
